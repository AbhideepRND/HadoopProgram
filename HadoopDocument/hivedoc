Errors 
During the create the table I found an error 
    return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.DDLTask. Cannot validate serde: com.hadoop.experiment.seqfile.ConsumerComplainSerDe
    
    The error is happen due to Typo
        Previously I am writing the Row format in 'ROW FORMAT SERDE' that's why it didn't work
        Now I change the SERDE -> SerDe it works.
        
To find the location of log in hive we need to check the hive-default.xml file 
    hive.exec.log4j.file and you need to check the log.properties in conf folder
